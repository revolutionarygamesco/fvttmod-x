This repository provides an
[X-Card](http://tinyurl.com/x-card-rpg)
macro for Foundry VTT.

The X-Card is a safety tool originally
designed by John Stavropoulos in 2013.
The original X-Card came with a spoken
explanation that needs a bit of
finessing for online play:

> I’d like your help. Your help to
> make this game fun for everyone.
> If anything makes anyone
> uncomfortable in any way…
> **[ draw X on an index card ]**
> …just lift this card up, or simply
> tap it  **[ place card at the center
> of the table ]**. You don’t have to
> explain why. It doesn't matter why.
> When we lift or tap this card, we
> simply edit out anything X-Carded.
> And if there is ever an issue,
> anyone can call for a break and we
> can talk privately. I know it sounds
> funny but it will help us play
> amazing games together and usually
> I’m the one who uses the X-card to
> help take care of myself.
> **[ pause ]** Does everyone consent
> to using the X-Card? **[ pause ]**
> Or is there another tool you would
> rather use? **[ pause ]**  Either
> way, the people playing here are
> more important than the game we're
> playing. Thank you for helping make
> this game fun for everyone!

It's hard to draw on a card, tap it,
or hold it up on a virtual tabletop, and
that’s where this macro comes in. The
social contract that goes along with
the use of this macro is the same
regardless of medium, though.

When activated, a player can send an
X either to the game master privately or
to all players. When an X is sent, an
X is displayed on the screen (either for
the game master alone or for all players).
In either case, the identity of the
player who sent the X remains hidden.
When you see the X appear, you should
edit out whatever was the last thing
said.

You _can_ volunteer that you used the
X macro and discuss why if you like,
but you’re never under any obligation
to do so. The reason why doesn’t have
to matter; the fact that you used it
is sufficient to make the change.

### Q&A

#### Why another X-Card module?

Mostly as a way to ease into module
development. If you’re looking for an
X-Card implementation,
[✋ Raise My Hand](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/raise-my-hand) by [Mestre Digital](https://foundryvtt.com/community/brunocalado)
may be a better choice. But if you’re
looking for a bare bones, no-frills
implementation, this could be just what
you’re looking for.

#### What’s so revolutionary about it?

Oh, absolutely nothing! That’s just
good branding. This is the first module
from [Revolutionary Games](https://revolutionarygames.co/).
They’ll all be “Revolutionary This” and
“Revolutionary That,” and some of them
(hopefully!) will even live up to that
promise, but this one is really just
doing something pretty basic. Then
again, maybe there’s some sort of lesson
in there about the simple, unglamorous
work needed to keep people safe in
revolutionary and liberatory movements.
